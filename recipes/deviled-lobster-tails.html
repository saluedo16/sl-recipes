        <p>These spicy lobster tails are so easy to make. 
            Just a note on the lobster tails in supermarkets: 
            if they're not frozen, they've been frozen and then 
            thawed. So, bypass the 'fresh' for the frozen, which 
            are fresher.</p>

        <p>Let's cook this amazing dish! Note: Substitute
            chervil or dill for the tarragon if desired.
        </p>

                <li>Preheat oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).
